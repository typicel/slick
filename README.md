# slick
A simple shell I created and will continue to work on adding some new features

## What it can do right now
1. All the basic shell commands you'd expect (ls, cd, pwd, etc.)
2. Any other command you want really, it's not that complicated

## What I still need to make
1. Adding env variables
2. Probably updating things to make the prompt look nicer
